### Group Coursework

---

## Setup

1. Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or any other virtual environment to manage dependencies and run in Python 3.7.x.

```
$ conda activate venv
```

2. Install project dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Commiting changes

I have set up a simple (bash) shell script to make sure all of our commits are as compatible as possible. Run this:

```
$ .github/run/this.sh "your commit message"
```

ONLY from the root of this repository.
